# lightdam
A DXR toy raytracer named after the light dams mentioned in Terry Prattchett's Colour of Magic


## todo & things to try

* write a proper readme
* materials & lighting
    * specular/more materials
    * support lights other than area lights [...]
    * sampling
        * simple MIS for next event estimation & direct hits
    * other light transport algorithms
        * bidirectional path tracing
        * photon mapping
* upload more scenes to repository
* russian roulette per warp (can I query?) instead of per ray for higher efficiency
* ...
